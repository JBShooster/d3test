# d3test

This is my first attempt at building a functioning line-graph with the D3 library. My goal is to chart the activity for a web site via data from a CSV file.

In order for the CSV file to work, I had to implement a simple-server. In this instance, I chose Node. In order to begin, simply go into Terminal, access the directory with the files and type "node server.js".

From there, you will access port 8080 in your localhost. 

The work is incomplete thus far. I was able to get a functioning line graph with dummy-data but so far having issues with determining how to render "Activity." Once I figure that out, hopefully things should fall into place.
